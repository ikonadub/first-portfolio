<h1>The Best Movies According to Isabella</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Night at The Museaum</h3>
<p>This is my favourite funny movie. It reminds me of when I was a kid and dreamed of being an archeologist,
   I also have a great appreciation of historical things.</p>
<h3>Dragon Ball Z</h3>
<p>Best anime. I enjoy the storyline of spirituality and the initial persuit they wanted to be young
    again, I find that everyone at some point thinks of re-doing their younger years in some capacity,
    but to me that is the beauty of real life making the best moments in real time and memories of others.</p>
<h3>Pretty Woman</h3>
<p>Super beneficial movie created before its time. To see how far integrity, lust and, trust, will go
    is good to have a realistic view that these things happen in real life, but at the cost of everything .</p>
