<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In this dynamic world of technology where ideas change frequently and technology evoloves daily,
   I am a enthusiastic and dynamic software developer. Coding was my first love that helped me to evolve 
   in technology and catapulted me into this field of creating digital ideas and formatting it into a visually
   pleasing data that is easliy read. Some of my projects begin at a basic starting point to show the viewer
   progress and the evolution of Isabella's coding.</p>

<p>I soon after obtained my Master Degree in CyberSecurity because I wanted to have a solid foundation 
   as a professional developer that understand. The internal ways of filtering in data that will create a view
   of expectation and or anticipation. It was important for me to be able to protect the code written or else 
   the information could be lost forever.</p>

<p>To think today dreams do come true my career is a compliment to my personality as ambivert that enjoys 
   proactively initiating ideas and formats that will best deliver towards the goal. It is my pleasure to 
   not only code for you and see your ideas become visible to share with your audience , but also to help
   you protect your code.</p>
